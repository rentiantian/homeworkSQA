# My Understanding Of SQA

SQA(Software Quality Assurance) is to establish a planned, systematic approach to ensure that the standards, procedures, practice and methods which are management proposed can properly be applied to all projects. SQA is designed to make software process is visible for the management. It verifies that the software is up to standard by reviewing and auditing software products, which will make the software project meet the requirements of institutional policy. 

In my view, software quality is extremely important for software. Poor quality software, even with rich functionality is useless. So we need a comprehensive software quality assurance system in all software development, testing and maintenance. It allows all members of the team to have a clear understanding of the processes and software problems, so that people can propose solutions for the case in the fastest speed. It provides a guarantee to the development and implementation of software. 

In recent years, software quality assurance is increasingly taken seriously, but most of our companies still lacking in this regard, which is the future direction of our efforts.
