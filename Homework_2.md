# Summary of the content of week 2

## Chapter 4

The main ideas in this chapter are quality assurance in context, the difference between defect view and verification&validation view, and how to measure and analysis defect. QA in context includes defect handling, QA in software processes and v&v perspective. Defect handling is include recording of status and tracking, causal analysis, defect removal, breaking the causal chain. QA is important in software process. It exists in all parts of the software process which includes requirement, specification, design, coding, testing, release. It will make the product meet its requirements and satisfies the user.

## Chapter 5

The main ideas in this chapter are software quality engineering, key activities in SQE and how SQE play in Software Process. SQE activities are the important part of development activities. The first thing in the software process SQE need to do is planning quality, the second thing is select the measurements&models. In the last, we should analysis if the quality goals we set is satisfied. 

## Chapter 6

The main ideas in this chapter are overview of software testing, which is include white-box testing and black-box testing. White-box testing tests internal structures and workings of a program. Black-box testing only care about what the software is supposed to do, not how it does. White-box testing methods include: API testing, code coverage, fault injection methods, mutation testing methods etc. Black-box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, state transition tables, decision table testing, fuzz testing, use case testing and so on. Software testing is a important part in software development. It will help us find errors, so that improving software quality,
